# Neural-Net-Tic-Tac-Toe
Neural Network for Tic-Tac-Toe

My first try at a neural network. It's a feedforward neural network that uses unsupervised learning. 

To use: 
Choose option #1 in the menu, and you'll see that the AI makes random moves because it hasn't yet learned how to play.   
Choose option #2 in the menu, and you can pick the AI to play against itself a certain number of times. 10,000 is good.   
Choose option #1 again, you'll see that the AI is now able to play at the max. 

The neural net isn't saved, so stopping the program wipes the AI clean.
